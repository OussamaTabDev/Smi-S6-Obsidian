### **📌 Types of IPv6 Addresses**

IPv6 uses **128-bit addresses**, offering a massive number of unique addresses. These addresses are categorized based on their purpose and how they are assigned to devices.

There are **three main types** of IPv6 addresses:

1. **Unicast** (One-to-One)
2. **Multicast** (One-to-Many)
3. **Anycast** (One-to-Nearest)

## **1️⃣ [[Unicast Addresses (One-to-One)]]**

Unicast addresses identify a **single** device on a network. If you send data to a **unicast address**, only that **specific device** will receive it.

### **📌 Types of Unicast Addresses**

| **Type**                 | **Description**                                                                                          | **Example**          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Global Unicast (GUA)** | Public IPv6 address, routable on the internet.                                                           | `2001:db8::1`        |
| **Link-Local**           | Automatically assigned for communication within a local network. Required for every IPv6-enabled device. | `FE80::1`            |
| **Unique Local (ULA)**   | Private address, similar to IPv4 private addresses (e.g., `192.168.x.x`). Used in internal networks.     | `FC00::/7`           |
| **Loopback**             | Used for self-testing, like IPv4’s `127.0.0.1`.                                                          | `::1`                |
| **Embedded IPv4**        | Allows IPv6 to communicate with IPv4.                                                                    | `::FFFF:192.168.1.1` |

🔹 **Most common unicast addresses:** **Global Unicast (Internet)** & **Link-Local (Local network)**.

## **2️⃣ [[Multicast Addresses (One-to-Many)]]**

Multicast addresses are used to send data to **multiple devices** at once (group communication). Unlike **broadcasting in IPv4**, IPv6 **only sends to subscribed devices**, making it more efficient.

🔹 **Example Use Cases:**

- Streaming videos to multiple users.
- Sending system updates to a group of servers.

**IPv6 Multicast Address Example:**  
`FF02::1` → All nodes on a local network.  
`FF02::2` → All routers on a local network.

🔹 **Multicast addresses always start with** `FF00::/8`. 


---

## **3️⃣ [[Anycast Addresses (One-to-Nearest)]]**

Anycast addresses are assigned to **multiple** devices, but **the nearest one (based on routing) responds first**.

🔹 **Use Cases:**

- CDN (Content Delivery Networks) – Routes users to the closest server.
- Load balancing – Distributes network traffic efficiently.

✅ Anycast **improves speed & reliability** by connecting users to the best location.

## **🔎 IPv6 Address Types Summary**

|**Address Type**|**Purpose**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Unicast**|Communication with a single device.|`2001:db8::1` (Global), `FE80::1` (Link-Local)|
|**Multicast**|Communication with multiple devices.|`FF02::1` (All nodes), `FF02::2` (All routers)|
|**Anycast**|Communication with the nearest available device.|Used in **CDNs, DNS, load balancing**|

---

### **🚀 Key Takeaways**

✔ **Unicast** – Used for **regular communication** (Global, Link-Local, ULA, Loopback).  
✔ **Multicast** – Used for **group communication** (Video streaming, network services).  
✔ **Anycast** – Used for **finding the nearest server** (CDNs, fast internet access).
