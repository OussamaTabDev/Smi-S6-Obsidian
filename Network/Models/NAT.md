### **📌 What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?**

**NAT (Network Address Translation)** is a networking process that allows multiple devices on a **local network** to share a **single public IP address** when connecting to the internet.

🔹 **Why is NAT Needed?**

- IPv4 has a limited number of addresses (only **4.3 billion** possible).
- NAT helps conserve IPv4 addresses by letting many devices use **one public IP**.
- It provides **security** by hiding private IPs from the internet.

## **🔹 How NAT Works (Simple Example)**

Imagine your **home Wi-Fi**:

- Your **router** has a **public IP address** (e.g., `203.0.113.1`).
- Your devices (laptop, phone, smart TV) have **private IPs** (e.g., `192.168.1.10`, `192.168.1.11`).
- When you visit **Google**, NAT **translates** your private IP to the public IP (`203.0.113.1`).
- Google **responds to the public IP**, and NAT sends the response back to the correct device.

🔹 **This allows multiple devices to share the same internet connection!**

## **🔹 Types of NAT**

|**Type**|**Description**|**Example Use Case**|
|---|---|---|
|**Static NAT**|Maps one private IP to one public IP.|Used for hosting web servers.|
|**Dynamic NAT**|Assigns public IPs from a pool dynamically.|Used in ISPs with limited public IPs.|
|**PAT (Port Address Translation)**|Multiple devices share one public IP using different ports.|Most common type (used in home routers).|

## **🔹 Real-Life Examples of NAT**

1️⃣ **Home Wi-Fi Network:**

- Your router translates **many devices** (phones, laptops) to a **single public IP**.

2️⃣ **Company Networks:**

- Large offices with thousands of devices use NAT to access the internet with **limited public IPs**.

3️⃣ **Game Consoles & Online Gaming:**

- **NAT type (Open, Moderate, Strict)** affects online gaming connectivity.
