### **ðŸ“Œ What is Bandwidth?**

**Bandwidth** is the **maximum amount of data** that can be transmitted over a network **in a given time**. It is usually measured in **bits per second (bps)**, such as:

- **Kbps** (Kilobits per second) â†’ 1,000 bps
- **Mbps** (Megabits per second) â†’ 1,000,000 bps
- **Gbps** (Gigabits per second) â†’ 1,000,000,000 bps

## **ðŸ”¹ Example: Internet Bandwidth**

Imagine you have a **100 Mbps internet connection**.

- This means your network can transfer up to **100 Megabits per second**.
- If you download a **500 MB file**, it will take about **40 seconds** at full speed.

## **ðŸ”¹ Bandwidth vs. Speed**

ðŸš€ **Bandwidth** is like a **highway**:

- **More bandwidth** = More lanes = More cars (data) can pass at once.
- **Less bandwidth** = Fewer lanes = Traffic congestion (slower data transfer).

âš¡ **Speed** refers to how **fast** data moves, while **bandwidth** refers to how **much** data can move at once.

## **ðŸ”¹ Bandwidth in Real Life**

|**Scenario**|**Bandwidth Needed**|
|---|---|
|Browsing websites|1-5 Mbps|
|Watching HD videos|5-10 Mbps|
|Watching 4K videos|25 Mbps+|
|Online gaming|10-50 Mbps|
|Video conferencing (Zoom)|10-20 Mbps|
|Downloading large files|100 Mbps+|

### **ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways**

âœ” **Higher bandwidth = More data transfer at once**.  
âœ” **Measured in Mbps or Gbps**.  
âœ” **More users & devices require more bandwidth**.
